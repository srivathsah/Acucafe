AcuCafe has an ordering system which is poorly designed and sometime fails to deliver the right orders. For example, some of the clients complaint that their ice tea had milk in it. Also, the system turned out to be a maintenance nightmare as it is difficult to add new drinks.

AcuCafe has selected you to update their ordering system to be able to:
-	Stop the preparation of an ice tea with milk and inform the barista
-	Add a new chocolate topping to the expresso
Can you think of any new requirements that can impact your design?
